-  What fields you used:
For this assignment, I used the fields ALAND, AWATER, and Shape_Area to determine the percentages of the county area covered by land and water.  
   -  Why you used these fields
   I used these fields because they were the numerical fields I could play around with and use to determine other aspects of the counties. Mostly, these fields were the first ideas I had to add to the dataset.
   -  What problems could the data set have
   There could be human error, or measurement error (i.e. maybe with an instrument), among other problems the dataset could have, such as land debates.
