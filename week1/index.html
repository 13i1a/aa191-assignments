            Hi! My name is Leila Brenner and I have recently graduated from UCLA with a Bachelor's of Arts in Geography/Environmental Studies. I was born and raised in New York, NY and love to explore new places and environments. In my free time, one could find me reading, walking, hanging out with my dog (pictured above) or my friends, or enjoying being outside. I love to listen to music and podcasts. My goals as a critical map maker can be encapsulated in the following: be includsive and be thoughtful. I want to ensure that my maps are beneficial for a community, for people, not for a company or corporation, especially for projects concerning this class. I want my maps to be:
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>
             Beautiful   
            </li>
            <li>
                Full of information
            </li>
            <li>
                Easily understood
            </li>
        </ol>
